# DVC Project

This project utilizes Data Version Control (DVC) to manage and track data files effectively. Below are the details regarding the structure and usage of this project.

## Project Structure

- `data/raw`: This folder is intended to store the raw data files that will be tracked by DVC.
- `.dvc/config`: Contains the configuration settings for DVC, including remote storage settings and other DVC-specific configurations.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, typically including DVC-related files and directories.
- `dvc.yaml`: Defines the DVC pipeline, specifying the stages of the data processing workflow, including inputs, outputs, and commands.
- `dvc.lock`: Locks the versions of the data files and dependencies used in the DVC pipeline, ensuring reproducibility.

## Getting Started

1. **Install DVC**: Follow the installation instructions on the [DVC website](https://dvc.org/doc/install).
2. **Initialize DVC**: Run `dvc init` in the project directory to set up DVC.
3. **Add Data**: Use `dvc add <data-file>` to track your data files.
4. **Configure Remote Storage**: Set up remote storage for your DVC files as needed.
5. **Run Pipelines**: Use `dvc run` to execute your data processing commands defined in `dvc.yaml`.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [DVC documentation](https://dvc.org/doc).
